## Content

The starter project has HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 
I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

I started, opening `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality:
- I create a navigationbar and listitems, which are corresponding to the sections in the landingpage
- Used the click-Event handler to navigate to the propriate section.
- The section in the viewport is highlighted.
